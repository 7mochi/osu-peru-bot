# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for showing interest in the development of this project!

Our goal with this document is to describe how contributions to this project should be made,
depending on what kind of change is being performed.

With any contribution you make, we ask that your commits are named sensibly and similarly to the ones in our [history](https://github.com/osuperu/osu-peru-bot/commits/master).
At the very least, sentence-case your commits, and do consider prefixing the commit message with a component name in similar fashion to `CI: Add required import`.
If the reasoning for a commit is potentially cryptic, consider adding a commit description to it, succinctly explaining why it was needed.

# Code Contributions
- The git branch should be based on and targeting the `master` branch. You should also try to create the branch
  from the most recent commit on master possible, to keep history clean.
- If the pull request closes an issue, link that issue with [closing
  keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)
  referring to that issue.
